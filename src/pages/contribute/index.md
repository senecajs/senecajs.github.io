# Contribute
[Seneca][], [Senecajs.org][], and all official plugins are __open__ projects and encourage
participation. If you feel you can help in any way, be it with documentation, examples, extra
testing, or new features, please be our guest.

Contributing is not always about adding new features. There are plenty of other ways to get
involved. For instance:

- Add more tests, be they unit tests or performance-based tests.
- Write guides and documentation or proof-read and fix existing docs.
- Report, find or fix bugs, or all three.
- Add examples of usage, patterns or integration with other tools.

Like any other project, there is plenty to be done by people of all skill levels and
specialities. If you have any questions, or want to help out, please stop by our issues
boards.

- For issues or questions about contributing, it's ask [here][org_issues]
- For issues or questions on Seneca itself, it's [here][code_issues].

Before you start, please read our code of Code of Conduct. It contains very important
information for all contributors to Senecajs. Once done, it may also be helpful to read
up on Seneca's core principles and roadmap. All three are linked below.
